Gort (http://gort.io) is a Command Line Toolkit for RobotOps. Gort provides tools to scan for connected devices, upload firmware, and more.

Gort is written in the Go programming language (http://golang.org) for maximum speed and portability.

Want to use Golang to program your robots? Check out our open source robotics framework Gobot (http://gobot.io).

Want to use Javascript on Robots? Check out Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com)

Want to use Ruby on robots? Check out Artoo (http://artoo.io)

## Getting Started
We now have precompiled binaries! You can also build from source:

```shell
$> go install github.com/hybridgroup/gort@latest
```

The Gort CLI provides many useful features on many hardware platforms, and has no other dependencies. You install Gort separately from any framework, which means you can use it to program Arduinos with the Firmata firmware also compatible with Cylon.js, Gobot, Artoo, & many other libraries.
